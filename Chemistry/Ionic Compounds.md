## Ionic Compounds

> Ions that are made from 2 or more different elements

- Ionic compounds are made from 2 different elements end in -ide
- Ionic compounds are made from 3 differenet elements end in -ate

> To break [[Ionic Bonding | ionic bonds]] significant energy is needed to overcome the elctrostatic forces between ions and electrons in the [[Lattice]]

- Because of this, they have high MP and BP
- However, in solid state they do not conduct electricity.
- Although they can't conduct electricty in the solid state, they can conduct electrity when in liquid state, eg molten or dissolved in water since the ions in the lattice can move freely.
