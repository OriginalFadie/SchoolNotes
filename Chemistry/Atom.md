## Atom

> The atom is what all elements and everything is made up of

- It Consists of 4 different parts: the [[Nucleus]]. which is the center of the atom, the [[Protons]] which are carrying the positive charge of the atom and also determine what atomic number it has, the [[Neutrons]] which are required for the stability of the atom, and the [[Electrons]] which carry the negative charge and determine what element it is.
- A positively charged Atom (Ion), known as a [[Cation]] is an atom with more protons than electrons, giving it a positive charge
- A negatively charged Atom is known as an [[Anions]] has more electrons than protons, giving it an overall negative charge
