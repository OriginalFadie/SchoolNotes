## Subatomic Particles

> Subatomic particles are the particles that make up the [[Atom]], eg the [[Proton]], [[Neutron]] and [[Electron]] along with the [[Nucleus]]

- When gaining/losing electrons, the nucleus does not change since they're on the outer shells. This means the [[Atomic Mass]] and the [[Atomic Number]] stay don't change
