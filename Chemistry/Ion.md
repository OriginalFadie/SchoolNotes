## Ions

> Ions are particles with positive or negative charges, created from atoms or molecules gaining / losing electrons, referring to the former respectively

> when [[Atom]] form ions, they attempt to fill their outer shell(to 8 electrons)

In [[Ionic Bonding]], a metal atom would transfer [[Electrons]] to a non-metal atom to reach a full outer shell, meaning the other atom to also reach that

- The group number is how many electrons they need to lose / gain, so anything under 4 is what they need to lose, and Groups 6 and 7 need to gain 2 and 1 electrons respectively
- Group - (Noble Gases) already have a full outer shell, so are unreactive, meaning they don't normally form ionic bonds with elements
- Ions can be made of 1 atom (e.g. F-), or combinations of atoms with an overall charge (e.g. SO4^2-), which are called [[Ionic Compounds]]
